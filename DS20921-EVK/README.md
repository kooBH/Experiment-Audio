# Senario  
1. target speech + 2-channel noise 
  
2. target speech + 2-channel(noise speech + noise)

For each senario noise must be choosen randomly.    
To perform experiments, the seed must be fixed for every experiment.   

Going to use Studio capture audio iterface, so the output for the speaker will be 3-channel.
