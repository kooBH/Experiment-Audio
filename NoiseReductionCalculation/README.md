2025.05.13  

## Goal  
To calculate noise reduction performance for mobile

## Data  
- speech data

## Playing
- speech + white noise  
- Noise must be longer than speech  
- Processed noise only segments will be used for noise reduction   
- pause after each play 

## Recording

- Single long audio will be recorded

## Parsing
- parse audio basend on pauses
